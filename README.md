ShareALink

ShareALink is a Spring application that allows users to share links with each other in a secure and organized way.

Features

Token-based authentication: User's identity is verified using tokens, which ensures that only authorized users can access the application's resources.

Cookie-based session management: User's session is managed using cookies, which allows the application to remember the user's login status between requests.

Pagination: The search results are displayed in a paginated format, which makes it easy for users to navigate through large sets of data.

HTML templates: The application uses HTML templates to display the search results and other pages, which makes it easy to customize the look and feel of the application.

Getting started
To run the application, you will need to have Java and Maven installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can clone the repository and run the following command to start the application:

In your browser go to localhost:8080, then hit Register Now!
Start creating your link. The site will automatically paginate after every 10 post.

Note
Please make sure that you have your own application.properties file in the resources folder with your own database configuration setup.

Conclusion
ShareALink is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to share links in a secure and organized way. With its token-based authentication, cookie-based session management, pagination, and HTML templates, it is the perfect tool for anyone looking to share links with others in a professional setting. Give it a try and see how it can improve your link sharing experience!
